## India COVID-19 Test Positivity Data

This repository parses & archives daily district-level COVID-19 test positivity rates for India. The test positivity rate is the share of Covid tests that are positive.

From 10th May onwards, the [Indian Ministry of Health](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) has been uploading a daily Excel file that reports the 6-day average COVID-19 test positivity rate (for Indian districts with a test positivity rate â‰¥ 10%). From 26th May onwards, this data set has been expanded to include data from all districts.

This repository automatically fetches the daily government data update, parses the data and appends it to a CSV file, and archives the government data file.

We also calculate the test positivity rates for Indian states & union territories using data collected by [covid19india.org](https://github.com/covid19india/api). The positivity rate is calculated as follows: `test positivity rate (7 day average) = new confirmed cases in the past week / tests conducted in the past week`. Note that there may be some discrepancies between states depending on whether they report the number of samples tested or the number of people tested.

## Data Files

- The [archive](https://github.com/aatishb/indiatestpositivitydata/tree/main/archive) folder contains an archive of the daily government Excel files with test positivity data for districts
- [districtdata.csv](https://github.com/aatishb/indiatestpositivitydata/blob/main/districtdata.csv) contains time-series test positivity data for districts
- [statedata.csv](https://github.com/aatishb/indiatestpositivitydata/blob/main/statedata.csv) contains time-series test positivity data, weekly confirmed cases, and weekly tests for states & union territories

The date is in ISO format i.e. `YYYY-MM-DD`. District-level data is for the 6 day period preceding the date on which the data is reported, while state-level data is for the 7 day period including the date on which the data is reported.

## Data Sources
- District Data: [Indian Ministry of Health](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/)
- State Data: [covid19india.org](https://github.com/covid19india/api) (collected from state health ministries by volunteers)
 
## Manual Data Updates

- 2021-05-13: Renamed misnamed state 'A' to 'Tamil Nadu'

## Known Data Issues & Format Changes

Prior to May 26th, the Ministry of Health data did not include district-level data for Telangana. This data can be found on the Telangana Department of Health [Media Bulletins](https://covid19.telangana.gov.in/announcements/media-bulletins/).

On May 26th, the Ministry of Health  changed their data format to include data from all districts (i.e. not just districts with > 10% positivity). We have updated our script to parse this new data format.
