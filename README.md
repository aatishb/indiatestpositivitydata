## India COVID-19 Test Positivity Data
### This project parses & archives daily district-level COVID-19 Test Positivity Rates for India.

The **COVID-19 Test Positivity Rate** is the share of COVID-19 tests that are positive.

From 10th May onwards, the [Indian Ministry of Health](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) has been providing a daily Excel file reporting a 6-day average COVID-19 test positivity rate (for districts with a test positivity rate â‰¥ 10%). These Excel files are available for one day and are not archived by the government. This GitHub  repository automatically runs a script to fetch the daily government data update, parses the data into a CSV file, and archives each Excel file.

We also calculate state-level test positivity rate using the most recent case & testing numbers collected by [covid19india.org](https://github.com/covid19india/api). The State-level test positivity rate is computed as a 7 day average using the formula: `test positivity rate (7 day average) = confirmed cases in past week / tests conducted in past week`. Note that there may be some discrepancies between states depending on whether they report the number of samples tested or the number of people tested.

## Data Files

- The [archive](https://github.com/aatishb/indiatestpositivitydata/tree/main/archive) folder contains archives of each day's xlsx file released by the government
- [districtdata.csv](https://github.com/aatishb/indiatestpositivitydata/blob/main/districtdata.csv) contains time-series district-level test positivity data in CSV format.
- [statedata.csv](https://github.com/aatishb/indiatestpositivitydata/blob/main/statedata.csv) contains time-series state-level test positivity data, weekly confirmed cases, and weekly tests in CSV format.

The date is in ISO format i.e. `YYYY-MM-DD`. District-level data is for the 6 day period not including the date on which the data is reported, while state-level data is for the 7 day period including the date on which the data is reported.

## Data Sources
- District Data: [Indian Ministry of Health](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/)
- State Data: [covid19india.org](https://github.com/covid19india/api) (manually collected from state health ministries)
 
## Manual Data Updates

The following steps were taken to clean the daily data in [districtdata.csv](https://github.com/aatishb/indiatestpositivitydata/blob/main/data.csv)
